### Mark Sellors 😷🐠🥑

Hello, I'm Mark, generally to be found as [@sellorm](https://twitter.com/sellorm) in online spaces.

I'm interested in technology, open-source, R and Python and the infrastructure required to run open-source and open-data based data science.

If you like R, you might be interested in my [R4Pi project](https://r4pi.org) that brings new versions of R, as well as pre-built package binaries, to the Raspberry Pi family of computers.

My [blog](https://blog.sellorm.com) is where you'll find most of my writing.

I also have a bunch of random projects 😂
